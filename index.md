## About Me

Hello, I am a Research Master’s student in Social Sciences at the **École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS)** with a specialisation in Political Studies. I am interested in studying the causes and consequences of socio-economic inequality and social policies to foster social mobility and well-being with a focus on my home country, India. Currently, I am doing a research master's at **École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales**. 

Previously, I have been a student of Études Politiques at [NCEP](https://formations.parisnanterre.fr/fr/catalogue-des-formations/licence-lmd-03/etudes-politiques-licence-KBW4N3HC.html) and at **École Polytechnique**. I have also interned in startups, in growth team of [Ankorstore](https://www.ankorstore.com/) and as a business analyst at [Ayolab](https://www.ayolab.com/) and now, I work as a Public Policy Consultant at [Autonomii](https://autonomii.fr/etudes-conseil/).

Beyond work, I paint, run, and debate for the [EHESS FDA team](https://www.ehess.fr/fr/vie-%C3%A9tudiante/french-debating-association-tournament-bonne-chance-%C3%A9tudiantes-et-%C3%A9tudiants).
