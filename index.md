## About Me

Hello, I am a Research Master’s student in Social Sciences at the [École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales](https://www.ehess.fr/fr) (EHESS) with a specialization in Political Studies. I am interested in studying the causes and consequences of socio-economic inequality and social policies to foster social mobility and well-being, with a focus on my home country, India.

Previously, I was a student of Études Politiques at [NCEP](https://formations.parisnanterre.fr/fr/catalogue-des-formations/licence-lmd-03/etudes-politiques-licence-KBW4N3HC.html) and at [École Polytechnique](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/). I also have internship experience in startups, specifically in the growth team at [Ankorstore](https://www.ankorstore.com/) and as a business analyst at [Ayolab](https://www.ayolab.com/). Currently, I work as a Public Policy Consultant at [Autonomii](https://autonomii.fr/etudes-conseil/).

Beyond work, I enjoy painting, running, and debating for the [EHESS FDA team](https://www.ehess.fr/fr/vie-%C3%A9tudiante/french-debating-association-tournament-bonne-chance-%C3%A9tudiantes-et-%C3%A9tudiants).
