## About Me

I am an Indian in Paris and I am passionate about social policies.

Currently, I am doing a research master's at **École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales**. My research is on social attachment of current and recently ex-high school students. My work is supervised by [Serge Paugam](https://www.serge-paugam.fr/). Previously, I studied Political Studies at [NCEP](https://formations.parisnanterre.fr/fr/catalogue-des-formations/licence-lmd-03/etudes-politiques-licence-KBW4N3HC.html) and **École Polytechnique**. I also worked in the growth team of [Ankorstore](https://www.ankorstore.com/) and as a business analyst at [Ayolab](https://www.ayolab.com/). 

When I am not being serious, I paint, run, and debate for the [EHESS FDA team](https://www.ehess.fr/fr/vie-%C3%A9tudiante/french-debating-association-tournament-bonne-chance-%C3%A9tudiantes-et-%C3%A9tudiants).
