## About Me

Hello, I am a Research Master’s student in Social Sciences at the [École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales](https://www.ehess.fr/fr) (EHESS) with a specialization in Political Studies and I work as a Public Policy Consultant at [Autonomii](https://autonomii.fr/etudes-conseil/). My research interest in studying the causes and consequences of socio-economic inequality and social policies to foster social mobility and well-being, with a focus on my home country, India.

Prior to joining EHESS, I was a student of Political Studies at [NCEP](https://formations.parisnanterre.fr/fr/catalogue-des-formations/licence-lmd-03/etudes-politiques-licence-KBW4N3HC.html) and at [École Polytechnique](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/). I also have internship experiences in startups, specifically in the Growth team at [Ankorstore](https://www.ankorstore.com/) and as a Business Analyst at [Ayolab](https://www.ayolab.com/).

Outside of work, I enjoy painting, running, and debating for the [EHESS FDA team](https://www.ehess.fr/fr/vie-%C3%A9tudiante/french-debating-association-tournament-bonne-chance-%C3%A9tudiantes-et-%C3%A9tudiants).
